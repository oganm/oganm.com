## B. Ogan Mancarci

I am a PhD student of bioinformatics in UBC. I work on gene expression in brain cell types and try to extract cell type specific signals from whole brain gene expression data. 

Here's a [CV](http://oganm.github.io/CV/).

##  Projects

* [**NeuroExpresso**](http://neuroexpresso.org/) is my lab's database cell type specific gene expression. It was released with [Mancarci et al. 2017](http://www.eneuro.org/content/4/6/ENEURO.0212-17.2017) paper.

* [**markerGeneProfile**](https://github.com/PavlidisLab/markerGeneProfile) is an R package to infer cell type proportion changes from whole tissue expression profiles. My current work involves improving the reliability of this package and using it on as many whole tissue datasets as I can find.

* [**gemmaAPI**](https://github.com/PavlidisLab/gemmaAPI.R) is an R package that wraps the [API](https://gemma.msl.ubc.ca/resources/restapidocs/) for [Gemma](https://gemma.msl.ubc.ca/), our lab's manually curated gene expression database.

* [**ermineR**](https://github.com/PavlidisLab/ermineR) is an R package that wraps ermineJ, our lab's gene set enrichment tool.

* [**allenBrain**](https://github.com/oganm/allenBrain) is an R package that wraps parts of the [Allen Brain Atlas](http://portal.brain-map.org/) API. It focuses on extracting ISH images and syncronization between reference atlases and ISH images.

* I maintain bunch of other [**bioinformatics related packages**](https://github.com/topics/ogan-bio) as well. Packages for gene [homology](https://github.com/oganm/homologene) and [synonym](https://github.com/oganm/geneSynonym) detection, an [MRI visualization tool](https://github.com/oganm/brainspriteR) etc.

## Side projects

* [**staplr**](https://github.com/pridiltal/staplr) is an R package for PDF manipulation. I contributed its PDF form filling functionality.

* [**stockfisher**](https://github.com/oganm/stockfisher) is an R package that allows easy interaction with UCI capable chess engines through R.

* [**rdog**](https://github.com/oganm/rdog) is an R package that wraps the [zdog](https://zzz.dog) pseudo 3D rendering engine.

* [**import5eChar**](https://github.com/oganm/import5eChar) is an R package that reads D&D character data exported from Walter Kammerer's [Fifth Edition Character Sheet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wgkammerer.testgui.basiccharactersheet.app) and allows automation of character actions and printing PDF character sheets (this is where staplr contributions came from). It also includes a shiny app that acts as an interactive character sheet.

* [**printSheetApp**](http://oganm.com/shiny/printSheetApp/) is a shiny app that wraps import5eChar's pdf printing functionality for non-R-users.

* [**interactiveSheet**](http://oganm.com/shiny/interactiveSheet/) is the shiny app that ships with import5eChar package

* I maintain a dataset of D&D characters submitted to the apps above at [**dnddata**](https://github.com/oganm/dnddata).

* [**diceSyntax**](https://github.com/oganm/diceSyntax) is an R package that supports complex dice rolling syntax such as `10d8d3ro<3`. That means roll 10 d8s, reroll anything below 3 once, drop three lowest dice. import5eChar and my other D&D related packages depend on this

* I maintain [**other D&D related packages**](https://github.com/topics/ogan-dnd) as well.

* I run a small plumber [**API**](http://oganm.com/api/__swagger__/). Its main functionality is to create image from texts that are redirected to imgur. Try `oganm.com/api/t2img?t=Whatever`. Primarily developed for use in [Tabletop Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator/).
