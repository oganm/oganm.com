      <description>Static resource organization Code cleanup A wild issue appeared Homepage   This is still me rambling about the building process of this site but I have a better idea how things work. It seems like for now this blog is mostly about itself. I am generally happy with how things look but there are still a few visible and invisible changes I want to make to the site.</description>

      <description>Baseline Basic set-up Font-awesome (and emojis) [[menu.main]] Children A favicon Category links Google analytics and disqus Homepage   This is mostly personal ramblings about how exactly this site is born. Kept for later reference. Itâ€™s not a tutorial. Just a description of every single step I followed to build this. It will include dead ends and obvious mistakes. It might be somewhat educational but I know nothing about Hugo and very little about web design so it might also include misguided attempts at pretty much everything.</description>
