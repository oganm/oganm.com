      <description>This is mostly personal ramblings about how exactly this site is born. Kept for later reference. Itâ€™s not a tutorial. Just a description of every single step I followed to build this. It will include dead ends and obvious mistakes. It might be somewhat educational but I know nothing about Hugo and very little about web design so it might also include misguided attempts at pretty much everything.
