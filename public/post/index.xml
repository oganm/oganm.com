      <description>Homologene What is wrong with homologene? Updating homologene gene IDs Updating homologene gene symbols Update:  Bibliography   Homologene I am the author of a small package called homologene. The package wraps the identically named homologene database released by NCBI. This database includes information about genes that are homologues/orthologues of each other. It is structured as a simple table. One can simply access it by doing
library(readr) library(magrittr) library(dplyr) dir.</description>

      <description>Static resource organization Code cleanup A wild issue appeared Homepage   This is still me rambling about the building process of this site but I have a better idea how things work. It seems like for now this blog is mostly about itself. I am generally happy with how things look but there are still a few visible and invisible changes I want to make to the site.</description>

      <description>Baseline Basic set-up Font-awesome (and emojis) [[menu.main]] Children A favicon Category links Google analytics and disqus Homepage   This is mostly personal ramblings about how exactly this site is born. Kept for later reference. It’s not a tutorial. Just a description of every single step I followed to build this. It will include dead ends and obvious mistakes. It might be somewhat educational but I know nothing about Hugo and very little about web design so it might also include misguided attempts at pretty much everything.</description>
